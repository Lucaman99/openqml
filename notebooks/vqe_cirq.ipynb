    "Essentially the Variational Quantum Eigenolver is a variational quantum algorithm that allows us to find the lowest eigenvalue of a given Hermitian matrix. Solving this problem is useful for a wide variety of applications, from predicting chemical properties, to studying quantum statistical mechanics. We are going to begin this Notebook by discussing what VQE is and what it does. We will then attempt to find the ground states of a few different spin-based Hamiltonians (Ising and Heiseberg models). After this, we will look into some applications of VQE in quantum chemsitry."
