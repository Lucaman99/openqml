    "*It is important to note that for the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that the reader is familiar with variational quantum algorithms and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. If not, a tutorial on these topics can be found in the <a href=\"https://lucaman99.github.io/nomadiq/openqml/gallery.html\">OpenQML gallery</a>.*\n",

    "In 2014, Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann proposed a variational algorithm called the [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). technically speaking, this algorithm allows us to find the ground eigenstate of a Hamiltonian that is **diagonal in the computational basis**. By doing this, we are able to solve combinatorial problems (by finding a bitstring that optimizes some cost function). Consider some Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}$, that is diagonal in the space spanned by our $Z$-basis vectors. These computational basis vectors are usually thought of as all length $n$ bitstrings, for a collection of $n$ different qubits. For instance, for $n \\ = \\ 2$, we have our set of computational basis vectors as $\\{|00\\rangle, \\ |01\\rangle, \\ |10\\rangle, \\ |11\\rangle\\}$. For our Hamiltonian operator to be diagonal means that it can be written as a matrix, with respect to the computational basis in the form:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\hat{H} \\ = \\ \\text{diag}(h_1, \\ h_2, \\ ..., \\ h_n)$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Which means that the only non-zero elements of $\\hat{H}$ lie on the diagonal. The reason we are interested in Hamiltonians of this form is because we wish to find the bitstring that optimizes a cost function. As you may remember from the VQE Notebook, the goal of a variational algorithm is to find the minimum eigenvalue and correponding minimal eigenvector of a given Hamiltonian. The class of optimization problems that can be represented as diagonal Hamiltonians **only allow basis states, not linear combinations of basis states as solutions**. It is easy to see that the eigenvectors of this kind of matrix will be the basis states themselves, thus the minimum energy (the minimum eigenvalue) of the Hamiltonian will correspond to one of the basis states. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is a variational quantum algorithm, meaning that it is built with **parametrized quantum gates**. Basically, we have a quantum circuit that prepares some state (we call this state-preparation circuit the **ansatz**), where each quantum gate \"transforms\" the qubit state according to some complex number that is fed into the circuit initially. We let the quantum circuit be represented as some parametrized unitary transformation $U(\\boldsymbol\\theta)$. This acts upon our initial state:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$U(\\boldsymbol \\theta) |\\psi_0\\rangle \\ = \\ |\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the prepared state is then calculated (given by $\\langle \\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta) | \\hat{H} | \\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta) \\rangle $). Now, we take this value and feed it into a classical optimizer. We repeatedly cycle through this process, letting the classical optimizer choose $\\boldsymbol\\theta$ until we find the lowest expected cost. We then repeatedly query the circuit a certain number of times with the optimal parameters and choose the sampled value with the lowest cost (you can read more about why this works in the VQE notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The QAOA is in a certain sense very unique because of the specific way that $U(\\boldsymbol\\theta)$ is constructed. Specifically, the algorithm borrows ideas from [Adiabatic Quantum Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation) and makes $U$ an approximation/parametrized form of the time-evolution operator:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\hat{U}_T \\ = \\ e^{- i \\hat{H} t / \\hbar}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "for a quantum system that is being adiabatically \"transitioned\" from one Hamiltonian to another:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}(t) \\ = \\ \\Big(1 \\ - \\ \\dfrac{t}{T}\\Big) \\hat{H}_{0} \\ + \\ \\dfrac{t}{T} \\hat{H}_1$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In Adiabatic QC, the idea is that if one starts off some quantum computational process in the ground state of $\\hat{H}_{0}$, which is some \"simple Hamiltonian\", then if the system is perturbed adiabatically (as $T \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\infty$), the Adiabatic Quantum Theorem says that the state of the system approaches the ground state of $\\hat{H}_1$, thus effectively finding the ground state of an \"interesting\" Hamiltonian. QAOA is slightly different in the sense that it Trotterizes and parametrizes this time-evolution unitary. For a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-evolution operator is given as:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\hat{U}_T \\ = \\ \\exp \\Big[ - \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar} \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T} \\hat{H}(t) \\ dt \\Big] \\ \\approx \\ \\exp \\Big[ - \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar} \\displaystyle\\sum_{t \\ = \\ 0}^{\\left \\lceil{T / \\Delta t} \\right \\rceil} \\hat{H}(t \\Delta t) \\ \\Delta t \\Big]$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For the QAOA ansatz, we take the \"summation-form\" of $\\hat{U}_T$ (on the right-hand side of the equation), and we truncate it at some finite depth (rather than letting the number of terms continue off to infinity). Now, by [the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%E2%80%93Campbell%E2%80%93Hausdorff_formula), expanding this exponential in terms of qubit gates is going to be essentially impossible (as, in general, $\\hat{H}_0$ and $\\hat{H}_1$ don't commute). Instead of doing, this we approximate this expansion, by simply decomposing the sum in the exponential as a product of exponentials, and parametrizing the \"layers\" of the unitary, giving us the QAOA ansatz:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$U(\\boldsymbol\\theta) \\ = \\ \\displaystyle\\prod_{i \\ = \\ 1}^{P} \\ e^{-i \\alpha_i \\hat{H}_0} e^{-i \\gamma_i \\hat{H}_1} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\boldsymbol\\theta \\ = \\ \\{\\boldsymbol\\gamma, \\ \\boldsymbol\\alpha\\} $$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Thus, instead of slowly \"switching\" from one Hamiltonian to another, we use a parametrized circuit to \"jump\" around the search space, with the exponential $\\hat{H}_0$ acting as a \"mixer\" that explores the search space of possible solution, and the exponential $\\hat{H}_1$ acting as a \"cost unitary\" that evolves our state in the direction of the optimal solution. In the case of QAOA for combinatorial optimization, $\\hat{H}_1$, the Hamiltonian whose ground state we are trying to evolve towards, we set equal to the diagonal Hamiltonian that encodes our combinatorial problem. For $\\hat{H}_{0}$, we choose a **non-commuting**, usually simple (we will talk about the mathematical motivation for this in the section below) Hamiltonian. In addition, we often choose our initial qubit state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ to be an even superposition over all computational basis states, which allows for a large initial search space (note that this isn't **always** the case, sometime we can be a bit smarter, as you will see when we attempt to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem)."
