    "The goal of this Notebook will be to help the reader understand a very interesting, recently-proposed NISQ algorithm called the **Variational Quantum Thermalizer**. This paper was one of many that has been written by the quantum team at X, the Moonshot Factory in the past couple years. Essentially, this algorithm is able to use a variational approach to reconstruct the thermal state of a given Hamiltonian at a given temperature, which is a task that is performed much more efficiently on a quantum device than a classical simulation performing the same calculations (in a very similar respect to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver). In fact, as in the original paper, we will demonstrate in this Notebook that as temperature approaches $0$, this algorithm is completely equivalent to the VQE, making the VQT a natural generalization of VQE!"

I'm going to assume that the reader already understands why variational processes like VQE and QAOA work from a physical perspective (this knowledge isn't absolutely necessary, but it is helpful, and it just so happens that a comprehensive explanation can be found in my CV QAOA Notebook!)\n",
    "\n",
    "First off all, let us consider what we are actually trying to accomplish using this algorithm. We want to construct a **thermal state**, which is defined as:\n",

    "Where $H$ is the Hamiltonian of our system, $\\beta \\ = \\ 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature of our system, and $k_B$ is Boltzman's constant (we will set this to $1$, for simplicity). Inputted into our algorithm is this Hamiltonian $H$, and our goal is to find $\\rho_\\text{thermal}$, or more specifically, the variational parameters that give us a state that is \"very close\" to $\\rho_\\text{thermal}$, as one does in any kind of variational quantum algorithm.\n",

We repeat this process, calculating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for our transformed mixed state and use this value along with the Von Neumann entropy of our state to create a **free energy cost function**. We repeat the algorithm with new parameters until we minimize free energy. Once we have done this, we have arrived at the thermal state! The entire process look somewhat like this (this beautiful illustration was taken from the original paper):\n",

    "Now, that we understand what we are actually making, let's understand how the paper goes about constructing the VQT. We said earlier we will begin the process by creating a simple mixed state. Now, let's actually understand how we will create this simple state. Basically, the idea is to pick some $\\rho_\\theta$ parametrized by $\\theta$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$\\rho_\\theta \\ = \\ \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta} e^{- K_\\theta}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Our motivation for constructing our simple mixed state in this fashion is that it is similar in structure to that of the thermal state, which is the exponential of a Hamiltonian. In addition, recall that time evolution of a density matrix is given by multiplying it left and right by the unitary that is \"doing the evolving\". if you're not familiar with this, since we know that evolution of the form $|\\psi\\rangle \\ \\rightarrow \\ |\\psi'\\rangle$ is given by $|\\psi'\\rangle \\ = \\ U|\\psi\\rangle$, we know that some density matrix will evolve as:\n",

This Hamiltonian is quite simple, it is diagonal in the basis that we are used to operating in, and all we have to do is take our variational parameters and slap them onto the outer products of the different basis states. We can then construct our initial mixed state as follows:\n",

Now, let's convince ourselves that the thermal state of $\\hat{H}$ with temperature $T \\ = \\ 1/\\beta$ minimizes the loss function $\\mathcal{L}$. Consider the **relative entropy** between our two states. This is just an extension of the concept of **Von Neumann entropy** of a quantum state, which is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Getting back on topic, we must conider the relative entropy between two states. This is just the amount of entropy that one state has, with respect to another one. For instance, if I compared the relative entropy of two copies of the same state, I would get a value of $0$, as the entropy of both states is completely the same. You can think about one of the states as our \"reference point\" (just as the completely pure state is our reference point in the case of normal calculations of entropy). We define this relative entropy as:\n",

Thus, if we want to variationally learn the thermal state, all we have to do is minimize the quantity $\\beta \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\hat{H}) \\ - \\ S(\\rho)$ (we can omit the $\\log \\mathcal{Z}$, as this is just an overall added constant. This is exactly the loss function that we proposed that we use initially, thus we have shown that minimization of this loss function does in fact equte to $\\rho$ being in the desired thermal state! This is almost like a more general version of the variational principle: any thermal state that we prepare will have a greater \"free energy\" with respect to some Hamiltonian than the desired thermal state, just as the expected energy with respect some Hamiltonian of any pure state will have a greater energy than the ground state!\n",

This essentially means that we don't need to \"compute\" the entropy of our state after passing it through our ansatz circuit. Instead, we can pick an initial state with an entropy that is very easy to determine. This means that entropy is a function of only our $\\theta$ parameters, and is completely independent of our choice of $\\phi$! We can prove this fairly easily. Let's consider some density matrix $\\rho$, with $\\rho \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\rho'$ with $\\rho' \\ = \\ U \\rho U^{\\dagger}$. We compute the entropy of our initial state:\n",

Actually implementing a function that calculates the Von Neumann entropy is not too involved. We will take a probability distribution as our argument, which corresponds to the diagonal elements of the density matrix in its eigenbasis (which are just the eigenvalues, or physically, the probability of measuring a given eigenstate of the density matrix). As you will soon see, we will be dealing with many $1$-qubit systems, rather than one large qubit system. Thus, we wish to calculate the entropy of each of the $1$-qubit systems individually. The `distribution` variable is an array of pairs $(p_0, \\ p_1)$, which are the probabilities corresponding to $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, which are the eigenstates as our initial density matrices will each be diagonal in the $Z$-basis. We can take each of these pairs, calculate the sum given above, and return a list of entropies, for each subsystem:"
